#+TITLE: Ab MIDI controller
#+AUTHOR: aloysius

I am aiming to turn an arduino mega rev3 into a midi controller over the USB port with no need for any additional serial cables.

* PROJ work
** Purchase [1/3]
 - [X]  [[https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-mega-2560-rev3][board]]
 - [ ] [[https://www.arcadeworlduk.com/products/qanba-24mm-translucent-snap-in-arcade-button.html][28 buttons]]
 - [ ] housing

 
** Design [0/5]
- [ ] enclosure
- [ ] dimensions
- [ ] materials
- [ ] button placements
- [ ] connectors (neutrik?)


** Implementation [0/0]
- [ ] maintain a diary, might as well blog about it :)

* Design

Basic ideas for the machine:

- 6 rows of 4 buttons
  + this makes each row a perfect 5th
  + e.g. C major is (1,1) + (1,3) + (2,1) and patterns become nice
- 4 mode switches
- 0 potentiometers/analogue?

- all buttons are to have LEDs in them wired in as per fighting
   stick (on the non-ground pin of the button - see [[https://app.getpocket.com/read/3093475042][here]]).


Design material to be poplar sheets, sandwiched to height.
- How can we make sure there is enough heft to it?
  - embed some weight in one of the layers?
- What colour/finish do we want on it?
  - can I go all out on a design?
  - what would suit alice?


* TODO Immediate Tasks [3/5]
  - [X] contact acrylic cutters for quotes
  - [ ] consider methods for routing/bevel
    - can I hire a router?
    - does Chris have one?
    - if I'm going to do this then I need to also design these
  - [X] shall I just get plain sheets and cut them myself?
  - [X] investigate acrylic glues
  - [ ] create a list for the required pieces
